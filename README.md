📊 Credit Risk Scoring System for FinTech Lending
🚀 Project Overview
This project builds an automated Credit Risk Scoring System for FinTech lenders. It uses historical loan application data to predict the likelihood that a loan applicant will default. The goal is to assist risk managers and underwriters in making faster, data-driven, and explainable lending decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement
Lending decisions are traditionally manual, inconsistent, and slow. This project addresses the business problem:

How can we automatically predict the probability that a loan applicant will default, using structured applicant data, to improve risk-adjusted decision-making?

🛠️ Solution Overview
Key Components:
1. Data Ingestion and Preparation
Preprocessing raw loan application data.

2. Model Training and Evaluation
